I found [this letter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12611df7-d110-4fd6-9d29-86642f7d33c6) somewhere on the Internet. It's an advice about writing from the great C.S. Lewis to a schoolgirl. I wonder if it could be made useful for writing programs. Here's my attempt.

(1) Turn off the notifications.

(2) Read all the good books (like The Go Programming Language) and code (like Go [standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std)) you can, avoid nearly all small messages, blog posts, videos and tutorials. 

(3) n/a

(4) Program what really interests you, whether it's practical or not, and nothing else. (Notice this means that if you are interested only in programming you will never be a programmer, because you will have nothing to program...)

(5) Take great pains to be clear. Remember that though you start by knowing what you mean, the reader (this might be you in six months) doesn't, and a single ill-chosen name may lead him to a misunderstanding. In a program it is terribly easy just forget (or not to care) that you have not told the reader something that he wants to know-the whole picture is (or should be) so clear in your own mind that you forget that it isn't the same in his.

(6) When you give up a bit of work don't (unless it is hopelessly bad) throw it away. Put it in a folder (or a git repo). It may come useful later. Much of my best work, or what I think my best, is the rewriting of things begun and abandonded years earlier.

(7) n/a

(8) Be sure you know the meaning (or meanings) of every word you use.
